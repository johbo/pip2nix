"""
The build backend a source declares, read from its `pyproject.toml`.

pip's installation report carries core metadata, which has no
build-system field, so this is the one thing about a package the report
cannot answer and the source itself has to. Only sources need it:
a wheel is already built, which is why ADR-0003 leaves the ones Nix can
use alone.
