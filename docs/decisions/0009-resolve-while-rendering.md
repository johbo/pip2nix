# ADR-0009 Resolve while rendering

## Context and Problem Statement

The design chapter places `prefetch.py` and `licenses.py` under
Infrastructure and `models/package.py` under Rendering, and states that
dependencies point inward. The renderer imports from both: a source hash
comes from `nix-prefetch-url`, a `lib.licenses` attribute from
`nix-instantiate`.

Neither value is in pip's report. A hash is known once the archive is
fetched, an attribute only by asking the nixpkgs the generated file will
be evaluated against.

## Considered Options

1. **Resolve while rendering** -- the renderer calls infrastructure for a
   value it cannot render without.
2. **Resolve in the adapter** -- `report.py` obtains both and hands the
   renderer resolved values.
3. **Invert the dependency** -- the renderer declares what it needs and
   the composition root passes an implementation in.

## Decision Outcome

Option 1, as the design rather than an accident. Rendering is where it is
known which values are still missing: a hash already in the previously
generated file is never fetched, and no license is looked up when
`--licenses` is off.

Option 2 gives the pip adapter a dependency on nixpkgs and on the
network, and resolves for runs that never ask. Option 3 is the correct
inversion, deferred rather than rejected: the render flags and the
collaborators travel together through three functions, so it is a value
object rather than a parameter.

## Consequences

A unit test of the renderer stands in for the lookup rather than reaching
nixpkgs.
