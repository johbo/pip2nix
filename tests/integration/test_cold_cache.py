"""
The guard for ADR-0005, which needs a real index to say anything.

pip caches a wheel it built, so the backend of a package resolved from source
is compiled once and read from the cache forever after. That is why the defect
this checks for was invisible on the machine that had already paid for it, and
why every run here gets a cache of its own.
